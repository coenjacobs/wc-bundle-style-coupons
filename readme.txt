Enables store owners to make a coupon only apply when all products required for it are in the cart.

== Description ==

This is a fairly simple plugin that enables store owners to make a coupon only apply when all products required for it are in the cart. This plugin introduces a new checkbox when editing a coupon, that enables this new feature.

When you want to run a bundle deal, for three products, all those three products need to be in the cart before the coupon works. For example if you want to offer a 50% coupon for purchases of product x, product y and product z in a single order. Just a single checkbox enforces this new rule.

Contributions are welcome via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coenjacobs/wc-bundle-style-coupons).

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installationâ€™s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

Or use the automatic installation wizard through your admin panel, just search for this plugins name.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
