# WooCommerce Bundle Style Coupons
This is a fairly simple plugin that enables store owners to make a coupon only apply when all products required for it are in the cart. This plugin introduces a new checkbox when editing a coupon, that enables this new feature.

When you want to run a bundle deal, for three products, all those three products need to be in the cart before the coupon works. For example if you want to offer a 50% coupon for purchases of product x, product y and product z in a single order. Just a single checkbox enforces this new rule.

The stable releases of this plugin can be found on the [WordPress.org plugin page](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-bundle-style-coupons/), which also offers direct updates to your WordPress administration panel.
